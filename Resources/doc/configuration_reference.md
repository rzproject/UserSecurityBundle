            enabled:               true
            after_attempts:        4
            duration_in_minutes:   2
            routes:
                - fos_user_security_login
                - fos_user_security_check
                - fos_user_security_logout
                - fos_user_registration_register
                - fos_user_registration_check_email
                - fos_user_registration_confirm
                - fos_user_registration_confirmed
                - fos_user_resetting_request
                - fos_user_resetting_send_email
```

Please note that for either 'force_account_recovery' or 'block_pages' to function, you need to specify the 'route_login' config, also you must specify the route for the account recovery page.

Once you have enabled either 'force_account_recovery' or 'block_pages', you must specify the routes that you want blocked once the number of attempts has been reached.

In order that the forced account recovery process works, the limit must be set lower than the block_pages process, otherwise page blocking will supersede this and prevent it from working.

Replace Acme\YourUserBundle\Entity\User with the user class of your chosen user bundle.
